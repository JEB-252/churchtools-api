# Churchtools API

This repository makes it possible to access the churchtools api via User Interface. 

It was created due to the request to show all appointments of [evkila.de](https://www.evkila.de/) on a single pdf file.

Just run the run.sh file which will build the flask application as docker container and provide access to the api.

`./run.sh`

The application will be available on 

[http://localhost:5005](http://localhost:5005)
